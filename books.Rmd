title: "Fundamental Statistical Concepts and Techniques in the Biological and Environmental Sciences: With jamovi"
---

<hr>

This is an introductory textbook for learning statistics. 
I originally wrote it for the second year Statistical Techniques module that I coordinate at the University of Stirling.
I wanted a textbook focused on the biological and environmental sciences that used [jamovi](https://www.jamovi.org/) for module practicals.

The book starts with the very basics, so it is suitable for students with no prior knowledge of statistics and very little mathematical background.
It includes 26 chapters introducing concepts important for a foundational understanding of statistics and nine chapters on practical skills using [jamovi](https://www.jamovi.org/).
This book is [free to read](https://bradduthie.github.io/stats/) online, and you can also [order a print version](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Fundamental-Statistical-Techniques-Biological-Environmental/dp/1032692375).
I am in the process of making an audio book, which will also be free to download.
