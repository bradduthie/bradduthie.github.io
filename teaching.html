	<p align="justify"> At the <a href="http://abdn.ac.uk">University of Aberdeen</a>, I have participated in the Principles of Learning and Teaching in Higher Education programme, and I am a <b>fellow of the <a href="https://www.heacademy.ac.uk/">Higher Education Academy</a></b>.

I instructed three semesters of undergraduate Biological Evolution. Two of these three semesters used a distance learning (online) format, in which I developed lectures and course content through Blackboard Learn software. Additionally, I served multiple semesters as a teaching assistant for Biological Evolution, and as a teaching assistant for Introductory Biology. <br><br></p>

	<p align="justify"> To teach effectively, I believe that it is necessary to understand how people learn. Learning is a biological process that happens in the brain. When we learn, we are connecting new ideas to ones with which we are already familiar. This process requires that students think actively. As such, to maximise the amount of learning in a classroom, I use teaching techniques designed to maximise student thinking about biological concepts, building upon their knowledge from prior education and their individual life experiences.

As instructors and students, we can make ourselves more intelligent, more skilled, and more creative through our continued education. For me, as an educator, this process is exciting, of critical importance, and deserving of hard work and enthusiasm. <br><br> Effective teaching requires transparency between students and instructors, and students will be more willing to participate in learning activities when they understand how these activities will help them accomplish learner outcomes. Learner outcomes form the foundation of my course instruction, and I strive to make each outcome relevant, specific, and verifiable to my students and to me. This requires that course content be carefully selected and thoughtfully presented.</p>

<!-- 	Evaluating the importance of education is an exercise in philosophy. Specifically, to ask what value individuals and societies should place on education is to ask a question about ethics. How are we to live, and what is the role of education in living well? The importance of education is regularly acknowledged, but seldom examined from first principles. In my experience, the nature of education – its root into the very core of how we live our lives as individuals and in groups – is underappreciated, and sometimes forgotten or ignored entirely. Our ability to investigate the question of how we should best live our own lives is predicated upon, and limited by, our education. Consequently, our ability to live examined and fulfilled lives is primarily a product of our education – and I mean this in the broadest sense of the word, ‘education’. Education is therefore fundamental for the growth and well-being of both individuals and societies. It is not a means to an end of enforcing cultural norms or achieving economic gain. It is the process by which we learn to better our own lives and the lives of others, and the foundation upon which we expand and improve the human condition.
	My approach to education is learning-centred. As an educator, my role is to guide students through the process of learning key concepts in the subject I am teaching, namely biology. Doing this successfully requires getting students to confront their conceptual limitations in order to move beyond them. This requires a dynamic view of human intelligence and potential, and it requires a theoretical and applied knowledge of how people learn. Learning is a biological process that happens in the brain. When we learn, we are connecting new ideas to ones with which we are already familiar. This process requires that students think actively. In practice, my learning-centred approach is therefore a thinking-centred approach, and I evaluate my teaching as successful when I have evidence that my students are actively and appropriately thinking about biological concepts. Getting all of my students to do this consistently requires respecting each learner individually, and as members of diverse communities, and it requires a commitment to providing everyone with an equal opportunity to learn. Engendering active thinking among a diverse student body requires an evidence-informed approach to teaching, and a willingness to continue professional development in the theory and application of pedagogy. Finally, to improve the lives of individuals and society through education, it is necessary to consider higher education in the broader context of the community it serves.
	Thinking is done individually, so each individual is ultimately responsible for their own learning, but the conditions for new learning are facilitated by a learning environment that respects individuals and their membership in broader communities. An environment that respects all learners is key to my teaching because it is necessary for guiding them to new ways of thinking. Bridging old ways of thinking to new ones means stepping into the unknown. Betrayal of respect will inevitably lead to fear and mistrust, making it difficult or impossible to get students to take these steps. Establishing and maintaining a respectful learning environment is therefore required for effective teaching.
	Similarly, a learning environment cannot be respectful, or maintain the trust of students, if it does not provide an equal opportunity to all students. The learning of every student is valuable, so each learner is entitled to equal access to intellectual growth and the fulfilment of learning goals. Importantly, this is distinct from the stating that each learner is entitled to equal access to course material (though this is also true). Different learners may have unique learning abilities and needs, meaning that accommodations must sometimes differ in the classroom to ensure that students have equal access to fulfilling learning goals. Importantly, this argument for equal participation and opportunity within the classroom also applies outside the classroom. Because education is of fundamental importance to individuals and society, and the learning of all individuals is valuable, access to higher education should be accessible and affordable to all who wish to dedicate themselves to learning. 
	It is impossible to consistently maximise student learning without a working knowledge of pedagogical theory and practice, and without a commitment to continued professional development in education. Like any subject or skill, teaching at its best requires an understanding of key concepts and how to apply them in practice to achieve effective results. Of course, good teaching also requires experience, but to improve education, I believe it is necessary to actively reflect on and learn from teaching experiences. This requires a thoughtful approach to pedagogical practice, and a willingness to adjust and experiment with new methods followed by careful reflection on whether or not they improve student learning. I am dedicated to this approach, and to continued development as a professional educator. This dedication is reflected in my thoughtful application of, and reflection on, evidence-informed approaches to teaching, and my continued participation in formal professional development in pedagogical theory and practice.
	Education serves a foundational role in the lives of individuals, and it is necessary to acknowledge the broad implications of this role in society. In practice, this means recognising the influence of classroom, institutional, and national scales in affecting student learning. It also means acknowledging the role of higher education in preparing learners to become effective in their careers and as citizens in their communities. As a biology educator, I particularly value the teaching of fundamental biological concepts and quantitative skills, both of which are becoming increasingly important in a complex and rapidly changing world. Addressing major local, national, and global challenges of the twenty first century requires a work force and citizenry that is scientifically literate and supportive of higher education.
	I believe that education is a life-long process that is fundamental to the well-being of both individuals and societies. As teachers and students, we can make ourselves more intelligent, more skilled, and more creative through our continued and collective efforts. For me, as an educator, this process is exciting, of critical importance, and deserving of hard work and enthusiasm. -->
