		<h3><b>Overview of research</h3></b><br>
<p align="justify"> The diversity of species within communities and of individuals within populations makes processes in ecology and evolution inherently complex. For example, the nature of pair-wise interactions between species may depend on additional species in a community, and pair-wise interactions between individuals may be affected by other individuals within a population. Therefore, to understand interactions in communities or populations, it is often necessary to examine them among multiple species or individuals. My research primarily uses mathematical and computational models to understand interactions among species or individuals in complex communities or populations. I am especially interested in coexistence among multiple interacting species and mating strategies among multiple interacting individuals. In my doctoral work, under the direction of <a href="http://jnason.eeob.iastate.edu:8080/nasonlab/">John Nason</a>, I used population and individual-based models to develop coexistence theory for communities characterised by patchy, ephemerally available, resources. I tested the hypotheses drawn from these models using empirical data I collected from a community of pollinating and non-pollinating fig wasps and their fig host. Currently, I am working as a post-doctoral fellow under the direction of <a href="http://www.abdn.ac.uk/biologicalsci/staff/details/jane.reid">Jane Reid</a> developing models to understand how inbreeding strategies are expected to evolve in complex populations. </p> <br><br>


<!-- Need a general overview of research -- I primarily study complex interactions in evolutionary ecology. These interactions can be among species or individuals, but a key thread through my research is looking at complex interactions (i.e., interactions among multiple players). I look at these kinds of interactions through the use of analytical and especially individual-based models to understand species coexistence or individual behaviour, but my work also includes empirical tests of model predictions. -->

		<h3><b>Spatio-temporal processes affecting competitors of ephemeral patches</b></h3><br><p align="justify">
		Most organisms are not distributed uniformly or randomly in their environment. The positions and movement patterns of organisms are influenced by both biotic and abiotic factors, and these factors in turn can affect the ecology and evolution of species within a community. One focus of my research is on the effect that spatio-temporal processes have on the evolution and ecology of species that compete for ephemeral patch resources, such as the many species of insects that lay their eggs and whose larvae compete for resources on dung, carrion, fungi, or fruit. Using numerical and individual-based modeling techniques, my research shows that a trade-off between dispersal ability and fecundity can cause a change in species' competitive dominance when the distance to the nearest available resource patch varies in time. Better dispersers are competitively superior when the required travel distance to the next patch resource is farther away, and high fecundity is favoured when the nearest patch is nearby. With varying patch distance, long term coexistence is possible if a subset of each population is stored in patches of developing larvae over multiple generations. This storage effect is a necessary component of coexistence, and my research suggests that even relatively short periods of population storage can facilitate coexistence given rapid environmental change. My doctoral work tested the predictions of this model using data from a community of five species of non-pollinating fig wasps, which all compete for access to lay their eggs in the developing flowers of a single species of fig.</p><br><br>


		<h3><b>Population structure and inbreeding strategy evolution</b></h3><br><p align="justify">
		Inbreeding is widely known to have deleterious fitness effects for inbred offspring. As a result, it is widely assumed that inbreeding avoidance will evolve as an adaptation to avoid the negative fitness consequences of inbreeding, especially in populations in which inbreeding is obligately biparental. But models of biparental inbreeding also predict an intrinsic benefit of inbreeding, which stems from an increased relatedness between parents and inbred offspring. This elevated parent-offspring relatedness increases the likelihood that identical-by-descent alleles will be transmitted from parents to offspring, and therefore that alleles underlying inbreeding will increase in frequency. Ultimately, basic theory of biparental inbreeding predicts that whether or not inbreeding is adaptive will depend on a balance between increased relatedness between parents and offspring, and the reduced fitness of those offspring. Most biparental inbreeding theory is restricted to numerical models in which focal males and females are related to one another, but relatedness between and interactions among other individuals within a population are not considered. Using numerical and individual-based modelling, I investigate how complex relatedness structure and interactions within a population affect the evolution of inbreeding strategies. </p>
