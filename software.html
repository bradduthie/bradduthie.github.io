<h3><b><u>GMSE: An R package for Generalised Management Strategy Evaluation</u></b></h3> 
<br>
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=GMSE"><img src="http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/GMSE?color=yellowgreen" alt="" /></a> <a href="http://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/grand-total/GMSE"><img src="http://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/grand-total/GMSE?color=yellowgreen" alt="" /></a> <a href="http://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/last-month/GMSE"><img src="http://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/last-month/GMSE?color=yellowgreen" alt="" /></a>
<br><br>
<p align="justify">
The <a href="https://github.com/bradduthie/gmse">GMSE package</a> integrates game theory and ecological theory to construct social-ecological models that simulate the management of populations and stakeholder actions. These models build off of a previously developed management strategy evaluation (MSE) framework to simulate all aspects of management: population dynamics, manager observation of populations, manager decision making, and stakeholder responses to management decisions. The newly developed generalised management strategy evaluation (GMSE) framework uses genetic algorithms to mimic the decision-making process of managers and stakeholders under conditions of change, uncertainty, and conflict. All simulations can be run using the `gmse()` function.
<br><br>
Installation instructions for GMSE are <a href="https://github.com/bradduthie/gmse/blob/master/README.md">available on GitHub</a>. GMSE is available <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/GMSE/">on CRAN</a> with <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/GMSE/GMSE.pdf">documentation</a> for use.

<h3><b><u>gamesGA: An R package to find adaptive game strategies</u></b></h3>
<br>
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=gamesGA"><img src="http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/gamesGA?color=yellowgreen" alt="" /></a> <a href="http://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/grand-total/gamesGA"><img src="http://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/grand-total/gamesGA?color=yellowgreen" alt="" /></a><a href="http://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/last-month/gamesGA"><img src="http://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/last-month/gamesGA?color=yellowgreen" alt="" /></a>
<br><br>
<p align="justify">
The <a href="https://github.com/bradduthie/gamesGA">gamesGA R package</a> finds adaptive strategies for games characterised by any 2 &times; 2 symmetrical payoff matrix played over multiple rounds between two players. Players can therefore play one of two choices in each round against their opponent, and can base their choice on the previous three rounds of their opponent's play. Consequently, strategies can evolve to maximise payoffs that respond to an opponent's history of cooperation or defection, as occurs in the classic game of Prisoner's dilemma.
<br><br>
Installation instructions for gamesGA are <a href="https://github.com/bradduthie/gamesGA/blob/master/README.md">available on GitHub</a>. The gamesGA pacakge is also available <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gamesGA/">on CRAN</a>, with <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gamesGA/gamesGA.pdf">documentation</a> for use. Alternatively, the software can be <a href="https://bradduthie.shinyapps.io/gameGA_browser/">run directly from a browser</a>.

<h3><b><u>EcoEdu: An educational tool for modelling population dynamics </u></b></h3><br>
<p align="justify">
The <a href="https://github.com/bradduthie/EcoEdu">EcoEdu repository</a> includes files used for learning about model inference and model development in ecology. The goal of the software is to serve as a tool to help students think more clearly about how populations change over time, and why and how we can use modelling to develop ecological theory and predict ecological patterns. Specifically, this software models predator-prey interactions using both classic Lotka-Volterra numerical simulation and individual-based model simulation. I am currently in the process of turning EcoEdu into an R package.
<br><br>
For the time being, the best way to use this softare is through its <a href="https://bradduthie.shinyapps.io/EcoEdu/">Shiny application</a>. A <a href="http://bradduthie.github.io/BI4803_LabPractical.html">worksheet</a> is also available to introduce the software and suggest helpful exercises. Finally, a simplified version of the <a href="https://github.com/bradduthie/EcoEdu/blob/master/Eco_Mod_IBM.R"> underlying R code</a> is available for exploration in the <a href="https://github.com/bradduthie/EcoEdu">GitHub repository</a>
